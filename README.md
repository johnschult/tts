## Remark

Presentations are done using [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark). To get started:

- Visit http://remarks.sinaapp.com and drag the **Slideshow** bookmarklet in the upper right to your bookmark bar.
- Navigate to [using_remark](https://github.com/johnschult/tts/tree/master/using_remark) and click on the **Slideshow** bookmarklet.
- Page through the slideshow to get an idea of what you can do with **remark**.

New presentations should be in their own folder and should be named ``slides.md``.
